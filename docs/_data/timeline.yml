- title: Student | Computer Engineering | San Jose State University
  from: 2021
  to: 2024
  description: At San Jose State University, I developed a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer engineering. 
               My coursework spanned several critical areas including Digital Design, Microprocessor Design, Embedded Systems, Electronics for Computer Systems 
               and finally Computer Architecture and Design.
               These experiences have equipped me with the technical knowledge and problem-solving skills necessary to excel in FPGA engineering and digital design.
